ABSTRACT:
With the rapid expansion of urbanization, shafts are needed to provide access to tunnelling projects or be utilized for permanent works. Their construction causes ground movements, affecting nearby foundations and buried infrastructure. This study presents an analytical equivalent volume loss approach for predicting three-dimensional ground movements resulting from a circular shaft construction: namely, ground losses in the elastic isotropic half space as a sequence of cavity contractions around the shaft are employed. First, the applicability and accuracy of proposed solutions are evaluated with published case studies and centrifuge tests. Thereafter, the method is employed to investigate the influence of the circular shaft construction on the surface and subsurface soil displacements. Considering design ground losses, this method allows for quick estimations of ground deformations and associated risk of serviceability losses.

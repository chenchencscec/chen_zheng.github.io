ABSTRACT:
Deep excavations can detrimentally affect existing structures by causing a ground displacement field of vertical and horizontal movements. Consequently, in the case of deep foundations, excavation-induced ground movements result in complex soil-pile and soil-pile groups interaction mechanisms that result in foundation displacements and additional distress. Using an elastoplastic two-stage continuum-based analysis, the response of single pile and pile groups behaviour close to an ongoing and finalised excavation is analysed. Both the excavation-induced displacements and internal forces along the pile axis and at their heads are discussed. Results show that the excavation depth with respect to the pile tip, and the presence of a cap (for pile groups) have a significant influence on the bending and axial deformations of piles; and that the induced pile bending can vary during the excavation sequence. In addition, comparing the results obtained from single pile analyses with results from capped pile groups, preliminary insights are given into the importance of pile-to-pile effects when a rigid superstructure is present.
